New Year's is coming up in a few weeks. I have a terrible track record for following through with New Year's resolutions, but here we are again. 

I listened to a [Hanselminutes posdcast](http://hanselminutes.com/500/you-dont-know-js-with-getify-kyle-simpson) the other day where he talked to Kyle Simpson, the author of You Don't Know JS. Kyle used an adjective a couple of times in the podcast that stuck in my brain for some reason: "*uncommon*". He used it to modify the noun "curiosity" -- a key trait that he feels software developers should posses to become better at their job.

Pasting code that you found in a code pen or gist is a common shortcut for just getting your feature to work. Circling back around to understand the pasted code and why it works is uncommon. Looking at the documentation for your js framework is a common way to figure out a confusing bit of the API. Going through and reading the relevent part of the source code is uncommon.

Scott and Kyle discuss lack of time as one of the main impediments to nurturing an uncommon curiosity.  I share this sentiment. As the proud father of a 5 month old baby, my orbit has been forever altered. I don't have time to download and play with the latest js framework for the heck of it any more. But at the same time, as Kyle mentions in the podcast, I don't have time to *not* develop an uncommon understanding of the languages, frameworks, and libraries I base my career on. Bug fixes take longer to fix, performance improvements take longer to implement, and design flaws become more numerous when I'm groping in the the dark rather than truly understanding what I'm doing. 

So to come back to my new year's resolution: I'd like to develop a habit of uncommon curiosity. But this is kind of abstract, so to make it concrete and measurable, I'm going to use this blog as a measuring stick to see how well I'm doing. My goal is one blog post a week on something I deliberately dug into and learned that was above and beyond what was functionally necessary to solve a problem.
